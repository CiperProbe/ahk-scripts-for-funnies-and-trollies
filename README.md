# u need [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) for this (Both versions are fine.)

## (Most) Controls

- F1 to activate

- F2 to increase

- F3 to decrease

- F4 return to default value

- ~~And verious other keybinds, but they are a secret you must find, unless you dig the files~~

### Remember that some Control's arent Accurate. Experiment with them, Just remember that F1-F4 are the majority of most of these scripts.

There will be no updates or anything pre-released. (only when i feel like it)

---

Beware of increasing the value! It could cause epilepsy if used in-game (Specifically those like Right Spin)
