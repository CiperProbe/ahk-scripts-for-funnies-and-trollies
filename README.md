# u need [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) for this :з (Both versions are fine.)

## (Most) Controls

- F1 to activate

- F2 to increase

- F3 to decrease

- F4 return to default value

- ~~And verious other keybinds, but they are a secret you must find, unless you dig the files ;3~~

---

There will be no updates or anything pre-released. (only when i feel like it >:3)

---

Beware of increasing the value! It could cause epilepsy if used in-game (Specifically those like Right Spin)
